## About the Project

This portfolio is an online representation of my personal brand, my experiences, and my creative work—styled and themed around the mischievous yet lovable Pokémon **Gengar**. It serves as a digital résumé, a gallery of projects, and a place to connect with me. The entire site embraces Gengar’s dark-purple color palette, ghostly accents, and playful animations to evoke the feeling of exploring a haunted Pokémon world.

Key objectives:
- **Showcase Professional Experience:** A detailed timeline of my skills, education, and work history.  
- **Highlight Projects & Achievements:** Interactive cards and galleries that spotlight what I’ve built and accomplished.  
- **Gengar-Themed Design:** Consistent branding—icons, color schemes, and subtle animations inspired by Gengar’s ghostly personality.
